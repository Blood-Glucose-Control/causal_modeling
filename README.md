# causal_modeling
This repository uses FitBit data, including daily readiness scores, heart rate, sleep scores, SPO2, stress levels, body temperature, in combination with Gluroo's data on blood glucose levels, meal timings and details, and insulin injection records.  
The goal is to build causal models to analyze counterfactuals of insulin timing and dosage on the evolution of blood glucose levels.
